1) This is a web application made with plain JavaScrip, HTML and CSS.
2) I chose to make some nice interface.
3) There's a difference between the JSON and JSONP requisition. I hope the comments are enough to understand them. This is how I overcame the classic CORS issue.
4) This application was tested on the Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome (most recent edition - both). There's some delay to renderize the answer on Chrome.
5) There's no need to install anything.
6) I hope it's good enough!
