1) To run the solution, please open the file "index.html" on a browser.
2) This is a web application made with plain JavaScrip, HTML and CSS.
3) I chose to make some nice interface.
4) There's a difference between the JSON and JSONP requisition. I hope the comments are enough to understand them. This is how I overcame the classic CORS issue.
5) This application was tested on the Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome (most recent edition - both). There's some delay to renderize the answer on Chrome.
6) There's no need to install anything.
7) I tried to apply SOLID concepts as much as possible.
8) I hope it's good enough!
